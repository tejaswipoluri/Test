Hello Friends.

My name is Punit Singh. I am currently pursuing my BTech in CSE from Bits Pilani, Pilani Campus.

I joined this project to do my part in helping Nirmaan. I also like to contribute to OSS in general.

I work in the department of CCTV in Bits. I work in the flash division. I contributed to the Oasis 2k12 website. I code mostly in C, PHP, and Java.

Looking forward to working with you in project Rachna.
