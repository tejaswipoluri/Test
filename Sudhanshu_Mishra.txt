I am currently studying in BITS Pilani Goa Campus in Information Systems branch.
I am developing in php for last 3 months. I've worked with facebook API. I've also worked on a social networking project.

I've also written a python module called 'BigInteger' with some help from my friend which can do mathematical operations irrespective of the size of the numbers.
I love to do things in a pythonic way!
Currently I am learning Django.
